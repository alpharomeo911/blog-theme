I'm a passionate roboticist, researching in the field of perception, localization, machine learning and cognition. My journey and interest in robotics started from interfacing a simple rotary encoder with an Arduino micro-controller. After participating in different robotics competition, and gaining more and more experience, I started my journey as MS in Robotics student from Northeastern University. 

Apart from this, I like aerospace and aviation (funfact: I can fly B737 and love playing X-plane 11 and Kerbal Space Program). Looking forward to hear more from you guys!
